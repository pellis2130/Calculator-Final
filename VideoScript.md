# Calculator Final Project — Video Script
Hi — I’m Princess Ellis and this is my final project for SDC220L with Dr. Chris Fry.
I'll demonstrate:
1. Arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
2. Division-by-zero error handling.
3. Single memory store/retrieve.
4. Collection memory add/remove and statistics.
Then I’ll show the GitHub tag Phase Final and wrap up.  
Thank you for watching!
